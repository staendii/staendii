# yo, Iâ€™m Nico

Self-taught dev.  
I like writing code thatâ€™s **clean**, **fast**, and doesnâ€™t fall apart when you look at it sideways.

## ðŸ§± stack I actually use

### frontend
- React â€“ default go-to
- Vue â€“ used it, still like it
- Next.js â€“ server-side stuff, no drama
- ShadCN â€“ makes building UI way less annoying

### backend
- TypeScript â€“ donâ€™t ship JS without types
- Lua â€“ lightweight and weirdly satisfying
- JavaScript â€“ because you kind of have to
- C# â€“ for the grown-up stuff

---

## some things I care about
- readable code > clever code  
- performance matters  
- donâ€™t ship what you wouldnâ€™t use yourself
