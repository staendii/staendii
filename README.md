# yo, I’m Nico

Self-taught dev.  
I like writing code that’s **clean**, **fast**, and doesn’t fall apart when you look at it sideways.

---

## stack I actually use

### frontend
- React – default go-to
- Vue – used it, still like it
- Next.js – server-side stuff, no drama
- ShadCN – makes building UI way less annoying

### backend
- TypeScript – don’t ship JS without types
- Lua – lightweight and weirdly satisfying
- JavaScript – because you kind of have to
- C# – for the grown-up stuff

---

## some things I care about
- readable code > clever code  
- performance matters  
- don’t ship what you wouldn’t use yourself
